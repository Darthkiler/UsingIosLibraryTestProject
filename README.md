# Kotlin Multiplatform Image Viewer

This project is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) mobile application for iOS and Android that retrieves and displays a random list of images. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate the ability to integrate and use the third-party library **SDWebImage** in an iOS application.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Technologies

- **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** â€” Shared code for Android and iOS.
- **Ktor HTTP Client** â€” Used to fetch the list of images from the server.
- **Koin** â€” Dependency injection framework.
- **Coil (Android)** â€” Image loading library.
- **SDWebImage (iOS, via CocoaPods)** â€” Third-party library for loading and displaying images in iOS applications.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure
```
root
â”‚â”€â”€ composeApp/      # Shared code (Kotlin Multiplatform)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commonMain/  # Shared module (all business logic)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ androidMain/ # Android application (only classes that call platform-specific code, e.g., Context)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ iosMain/     # iOS application
â”‚â”€â”€ server/          # Server component
```
All business logic is located in the **shared** module and implemented using the **expected - actual** mechanism, allowing platform-specific code to utilize Android and iOS dependencies.
